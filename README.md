# SPC Fix for bundling CSS in a Virtual Directory
Currently the bundling service does not transform links to images correctly (i.e. css using the url method).
This plugin will fix an issue with CSS bundling when nopCommerce is installed in a virtual directory. 

See issue: https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/575

and pull request https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/pull/1671 which will hopefully be incorporated into the core.
